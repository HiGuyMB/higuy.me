# DifViewer-JS
Got bored, wanted to test WebGL, so I wrote a DIF renderer.
It seemed to easy so I slapped some bullet physics in there too, now it's yet another crappy marble game.

Not really meant to be anything big, just a little experiment I did.

Models can be generated using the json test from libDif's DifTests, but it won't do you much good unless you have something to host this on.
